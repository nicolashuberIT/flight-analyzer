## Conventions

Please find naming conventions for this project linked here: [click](/docs/documentation/conventions.md). In addition, static type annotations are used in this project. The code is formatted and linted in VS Code using the Black Formatter Extension and Pylint.

## Testing

The codebase has been tested using the `pytest` module. The recent CI/CD status can be found below. Click [here](https://github.com/nicolashuberIT/flight-analyzer/actions) for a detailed overview and unit testing logs.

*Please note: An issue regarding some tests failing with a FileNotFoundError when running pytest without specifying test files explicitly has been resolved, but the option to run tests using the `testing.sh` script persists; this workaround involves explicitly listing test files with their relative paths in a shell script and executing it to ensure pytest can locate and run the tests without encountering errors. For more details, refer to [testing.sh](/testing.sh), [update_testing.sh](/update_testing.sh), and [testing.yaml](https://github.com/nicolashuberIT/flight-analyzer/blob/main/.github/workflows/testing.yaml).*
